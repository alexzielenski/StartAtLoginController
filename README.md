# StartAtLoginController

Easy to use controller that makes use of the [Cocoa ServiceManagement APIs][SM]. This is the required way to do login items for sandboxed applications (required for all Mac App Store apps) and works in non-sandboxed applications as well.

It's been tested on 10.7 and 10.8 (and should work on 10.6.6+). Entries set by this class do not appear in the Accounts Panel of System Preferences.

## HOW-TO

### Helper Bundle

You must create an instance of the controller and set its bundle identifier to use to your helper bundle. (It must point to a helper bundle that has LSBackgroundOnly or LSUIElement set to YES in its Info.plist and put this bundle in Contents/Library/LoginItems).

For sandboxed apps, sign it with the same entitlements and developer id. Also, your can only be launched at login if it has been copied to `/Applications`.

Here is an example of a helper bundle:

	- (void)applicationWillFinishLaunching:(NSNotification *)aNotification
	{
		NSString *appPath = [[[[[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath] stringByDeletingLastPathComponent] stringByDeletingLastPathComponent]  stringByDeletingLastPathComponent] stringByDeletingLastPathComponent]; 
		// get to the waaay top. Goes through LoginItems, Library, Contents, Applications
		[[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] launchApplication:appPath];
		[NSApp terminate:nil];
	}
	
You can find a decent tutorial about this at [Tim SchrÃ¶der's blog post "The Launch At Login Sandbox Project"][Tutorial].
	
### Main Application

Then in your application

 * add the framework `ServiceManagement` and 
 * add the files `StartAtLoginController.{h,m}`
 
to your main app's target. You can use the controller either in code or with the interface builder.

#### Programmatically

When using in code, create an instance of `StartAtLoginController` by providing the helper app's bundle identifier:

	StartAtLoginController *loginController = [[StartAtLoginController alloc] initWithIdentifier:@"your.app.helpers.bundle.id"];
	
Now, you can manipulate the Services Entry:

	loginController.startAtLogin = YES; // adds the entry into LaunchServices and activates it
	//
	loginController.enabled = NO; // disables the entry on the services list
	//
	BOOL startsAtLogin = [loginController startAtLogin]; // gets the current enabled state
	
#### Interface Builder

If you want to use the interface builder

 * Place a NSObject (the blue box) into the nib window
 * From the Inspector - **Identity Tab**
   * Set the Class to `StartAtLoginController`
   * Add the user defined runtime attribute `identifier` of type `String` and set it to your helper app's bundle identifier
 * Place a Checkbox on your Window/View
 * From the Inspector - **Bindings Tab**
   * Unroll the > Value item
   * Bind to `StartAtLoginController` with the Model Key Path `startAtLogin`
